## Solution
1. First location is VIVOCITY. Simply look for the location of TANGS stores, there are two possiblities: Tang Plaza and VIVOCITY. The additonal presence of Giant will eliminate Tang Plaza, which does not have a Giant Supermarket according to it's online brand directory.

2. The carpark entrance is found by circling the building in Google Street View. It is along Telok Blangah Road.

3. The person is seen crossing a road. https://www.google.com/maps/@1.2655199,103.8208475,3a,23.6y,240.71h,78.27t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgP4lfKkjYB45F5yYbzC8_A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192. Turn west towards HarbourFront MRT station.
